- Never `git commit` unless I tell you to do it
- Never `git push` unless I tell you to do it
- Never run `npm run dev` unless I tell you to do it
- Only run `npm run build` when you're not too certain of your changes. For instance if you do a simple UI change, no need to do it. If it's a complex change you should do it.
